        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup of cool water, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of liquid rennet</li>
            <1i>1 1/2 teaspoons of citric acid</1i>
            <1i>1 gallon of raw milk</1i>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine 1/4 cup of water and rennet in a small bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Combine 1/2 cup of water and citric acid in another small bowl;
                mix until dissolved
            </li>
            <li>Pour milk into a large pot set over medium heat. Stir in the water-citric 
                acid mixture. Heat the milk, stirring occasionally, until it registers 90 
                degrees Fahrenheit on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the milk from heat and stir in the rennet mixture in a 
                figure-8 motion for 30 seconds. Stir counterclockwise for 30 seconds to still 
                the milk. Let it stand, covered, until milk sets into curd, about 5 to 10 
                minutes. Press the edge of the curd gently with a palette knife or the back 
                of a spoon to check for firmness.
            </li>
            <li>Slice verticaly into the pot to cut the curd into 3/4-inch cubes with 
                a palette knife. Stir curds gently, but leave the cubes mostly intact.
            </li>
            <li>Return the pot to heat; cook over medium heat, stirring the curds gently 
                until the temperature reaches 109 degrees Fahrenheit, about 5 minutes. 
                Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Ladle the curds into a colander set over a large bowl using a slotted 
                spoon. Press the curds gently to extract liquid whey. Pour the drained 
                whey back into the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Heat whey to 185 degrees Fahrenheit, about 5 minutes. While wearing gloves, 
                tear off a piece of curd and place on a slotted spoon. Dip the curd into hot 
                whey for 5 to 10 seconds. Stretch, fold, and knead the curd. Repeat until 
                the mozzarella is smooth and elastic. Knead in salt and form curd into a ball. 
                Repeat dipping and kneading process with the remaining curd.
            </li>
            <li>Allow the mozzarella to cool, then wrap tightly in plastic wrap 
                and transfer to the refrigerator.
            </li>
        </ol>
